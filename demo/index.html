					Welcome to Spike@School!
				</h1>
				<p>
					This page has been added by the staff at Spike@School to help you get started by walking you through making your first web page! Follow these easy steps:
				</p>
				<p>
					Someone in your school should have been set up as the administrator of your website. Their job is to begin setting up other users in the Spike@School system. Get them to create a user account for you. They can do this by:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Clicking the <strong>Admin Bar</strong> at the top of this page. The Admin Bar should appear. You should then <strong>click Admin System</strong>. This will take you to the login screen.
					</li>
					<li>
						Logging in with their <strong>username</strong> and <strong>password</strong> that was emailed to them by us here at Spike@School.
					</li>
					<li>
						Once they are logged in they should click <strong>Users and Groups</strong> and follow the directions from there.
					</li>
					<li>
						You should receive an email with your <strong>username</strong> and <strong>password</strong> as soon as they add you to the system. Now we're ready to make our first web page.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>
					Making your First Web Page
				</h2>
				<p>
					Once you have your <strong>username</strong> and <strong>password</strong> follow these steps:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Click <strong>Admin Bar</strong> at the top of this page. The Admin Bar should appear. You should then <strong>click Admin System</strong>. This will take you to the login screen. (You might want to print this page off so you can read it while you do the rest of these steps.)
					</li>
					<li>
						Enter your <strong>username</strong> and <strong>password</strong> and login.
					</li>
					<li>
						Once you have logged in, you'll arrive in the <strong>Construction Zone</strong>. This is where you work with the websites content.
					</li>
					<li>
						You will see this page "Welcome to Spike@School" listed. You can click <strong>Edit</strong> beside this page name to change the contents of this page (we recommend this), or you can select <strong>Page</strong> from the <strong>Add a New:</strong> menu to add another page to your website and leave this one intact.
					</li>
					<li>
						When you are editing or adding a page an editor will pop up and allow you to add contents just as if you were in a <strong>word processor</strong>.
					</li>
					<li>
						When you have finished making changes to your page click <strong>Save</strong> or <strong>Add</strong>. If you ever want to go back without making any changes click <strong>Cancel</strong>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Congratulations! You've just made your first page in the Spike@School system. Now it's time to explore the other modules to find out what else you and your staff can do. Our favourites are the <strong>Learning Caves</strong> and <strong>Staff Zones</strong>. These are learning and collaboration areas for Students and Teachers respectively.
					</li>
					<li>
						Don't forget also, that you can organise items on your site into Folders. Simply choose <strong>Folder</strong> on the <strong>Add a New:</strong> bar in the <strong>Construction Zone</strong>.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					We hope you enjoy using Spike@School as much as we enjoyed making it!
				</p>
				<p>
					The Spike@School Team.
